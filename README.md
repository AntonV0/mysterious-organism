# Mysterious Organism
## Project #34 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
The Mysterious Organism named P. aequor is a fictional creature that is comprised of only 15 DNA bases. 4 base types (A, T, C, and G) make up a DNA strand, and each P. aequor's strand is randomised. 

A factory function is used here to return the specimen number and its DNA strand. The factory function contains three methods; one mutates a single base of the DNA strand, another compares the DNA similarity of two PAequor species, and the final method calculates whether the specimen is likely to survive.

A while loop is used to create 30 instances of specimens likely to survive, storing each DNA strand in an array.
## What I Learned
  - Using factory functions to create multiple objects/instances
  - Methods that mutate, compare, and filter array items
  - The parseFloat() function and toFixed() method
  - While loops
